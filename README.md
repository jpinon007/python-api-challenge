# python-api-challenge

# Part 1: WeatherPy- I created a python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using citipy python library and OpenWeatherAPI map. I had to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code and created scatter plots to showcase the following relationships; Latitude vs. Temp, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed. Next, I was asked to compute a linear regression for each relationship. I had to separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Then, I was asked to create a series of scatter plots; Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude, Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude, Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude, Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude.
